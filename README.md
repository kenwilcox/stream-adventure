My answers to stream-adventure

I followed [Mikeal Rogers (mikeal)](https://github.com/mikeal) advice on [Future Aloof](http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html) and added the node_modules directories.

Hope this helps.

This was completed on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS (Trusty) with Sublime Text 2 and node v0.10.30

I don't like stream-adventure as much as learnyounode - a lot of write only code - code I write, but don't understand at a later date. Sigh
